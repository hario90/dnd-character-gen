Ask me a creative and interesting role-playing style scenario question that can be used to design a dungeons and dragons character.
The classes a dungeons and dragons character can be part of are Wizard, Fighter, Druid, Paladin, Rogue and Bard.

The question should be multiple choice, have up to four choices, and not be too similar to the other questions already asked.
The choices should also not be too similar to the choices in prior questions.
Here is an example of a creative question that I'm looking for:

On a clear day you chance upon a strange animal, its leg trapped in a hunter's clawsnare. Judging from the bleeding it will not survive long. Do you:
a) Draw your dagger, mercifully ending its life with a single thrust?
b) Do not interfere in the natural evolution of events, but rather take the opportunity to learn more about a strange animal that you have never seen before?
c) Use herbs from your pack to put it to sleep, then free it from the clawsnare and take it somewhere where it can be safe, knowing that in doing so you will probably deprive a hunter and his family of sustenance?

One summer afternoon your father gives you a choice of chores. Would you rather:
a) Work in the forge with him casting iron for a new plow?
b) Gather herbs for your mother who is preparing dinner?
c) Go catch fish at the stream using a net and line?

Your father and you are returning from the town market when you see a small boy running from a store. In his hands he clutches a loaf of bread. Behind him races the baker with a cleaver in his hands. You know that the boy must be hungry, but the town is suffering from a drought, which has made food valuable. Do you:
a) Side with justice and urge your father to stop the boy?
b) Help the poor waif by running into the baker's way?
c) Stand out of the way and wait to see what your father decides, trusting his experience?
